        <h2>It's Exciting to Share!</h2>
        <p>Here's a little description of me. I live in Peachtree Corners, a suburb city of Atlanta, GA. I have a cat named Skylar that is delightful company. I have a multitude of friends from my church, Northlands Church, Norcross, GA, so I'm often not home, which makes Skylar very glad to see me. Between ministry work and crafts and friends, my days go by quickly. Soon I will be starting a Christian mid-week evening home group. One of my new activities is helping a beautiful Ethiopian woman with her English pronunciation so she can use her coding skills in a professional atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Growing and Going!</p>

        <h3>Tender Hearts Ministry</h3>
        <p>I am an ordained pastor and part of my ministry is pastoral counseling. I am the Executive Director of Tender Hearts Ministy, a non-profit organization where I do individual counseling. I also facilitate one day journaling retreats for freedom from childhood emotional wounds that cause pain or discomfort now. I am called by God to bring freedom to His Bride. There is no charge for my ministry services, but gifts are certainly welcome.</p>

        <h3>Best Impression Colors</h3>
        <p> You never get a second chance to make a great first impression. When you meet someone, wearing the correct colors brings the focus to your eyes, which is where we connect emotionally with each other. This is so important in a job interview. I analize your skin, hair and eyes to make your personal palette determination. This process includes a case with your color swatches to take with you when you go shopping. It's worth the investment!</p>

        <h3>Earring Hangers</h3>
        <p>Creating earring hangers is a new enterprise. They are very time consuming because of the details and care I put into each one. I have 4 different sizes: small, medium, large, and extra large to meet you personal needs. </p>

        <h3>Add A Strand</h3>
        <p>Creating necklaces is so much fun! The way I make them is special. The strands are interchangeable. There is one small connector piece that I want to have manufacturered in a better quality before I go public and sell my creations. I also have plans for women to make their own necklaces with the beads I supply or with their own beads. It's coming soon!</p>

        <h3>Soccer Ball Lanterns</h3>
        <p>Everybody loves soccer! I can't play, so I make strings of lights with soccer balls that plug in and are hung up for decorating and entertaining. I also make individual soccer ball lights that have a button battery and look great on a table or hung individually.</p>
