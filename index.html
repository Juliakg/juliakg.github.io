        <p>It's Exciting to Share.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Here's a little description of me. I live in Peachtree Corners, a suburb city of Atlanta, GA. I have a cat named Skylar that is delightful company. I have a multitude of friends from my church, so I'm often not home, which makes Skylar very glad to see me. Between ministry work and crafts and friends, my days go by quickly. One of my new activities is helping a beautiful Ethiopian woman with her English pronunciation so she can use her coding skills in a professional atmosphere.

        <p>Growing and Going!

        <p>I am an ordained pastor and part of my ministry is pastoral counseling. I am the Executive Director of Tender Hearts Ministy, a non-profit organization where I do individual counseling and I do one day retreats for freedom from childhood emotional wounds that cause pain now. </p>

        <h3>Add A Strand</h3>
        <p>Creating necklaces is so much fun! The way I make them is special. The strands are interchangeable. There is one small connector piece that I want to have manufacturered in a better quality before I go public and sell my creations. I also have plans for women to make their own necklaces with the beads I supply or with their own beads. It's coming soon!</p>

        <h3>Soccer ball Lanterns</h3>
        <p>Everybody loves soccer! I can't play, so I make strings of lights with soccer balls that plug in and are hung up for decorating andentertaining. I also make individual soccer ball lights that have a button battery and look great on a table or hung individually.</p>
