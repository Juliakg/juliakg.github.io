        <p>
        My introduction to the Internet happened in the late 1980”s. I didn’t own a computer yet, but I was fascinated by the subject.  So I went to the public library where we were permitted to schedule the use of a computer for one hour a week. I did that for several months. Then I went to a seminar on starting an online business. We were asked what we wanted to do. I said,"Sell cookies!", and everyone laughed.  But I did it! In time, I started my online business selling five kinds of cookies by the dozen. My site was called <span style="font-weight:900">cookiemunchers.com</span>. I did very well until the “dot com implode” in the early 1990s due to a recession. At that time my focus shifted to other things.

        In 2011, I was managing a federal program and there were dollars for training. I was able to use some of those funds to earn a Certificate in Website Development and Management from Broome Community College in Binghamton, NY. During the following year, I developed several websites, but didn’t pursue it beyond that.

        Fast forward to now. I am in need of several websites for myself, and rather than hire someone, I am taking this class as a refresher and to learn the current methods. Many things have stayed the same, but one change has me very excited - CSS GRID. Wow. My graphics and creative side are all in.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Are you interested in having a website? It would be my pleasure to develop one for you.</p>
