  <p>My introduction to the Internet happened in the late 1980”s. I didn’t own a computer yet, but I was fascinated by the subject.  So I went to the public library where we were permitted to schedule the use of a computer for one hour a week. I did that for several months.  In time, I started an online business selling five kinds of cookies by the dozen. My site was called cookiemunchers.com. I did very well until the “dot com implode” in the early 1990s due to a recession. At that time my focus shifted to other things.
  In 2011, I was managing a federal program and there were dollars for training. I used that money to earn a Certificate in Website Development and Management. I developed several websites, but didn’t pursue it beyond that. Fast forward to now. I am in need of several websites for myself, and rather than hire someone, I am taking this class as a refresher and to learn the current methods.
